# Comment on Giorcelli & Moser (2020), “Copyrights and Creativity: Evidence from Italian Opera in the Napoleonic Age,” *Journal of Political Economy*.  

## Overview

Giorcelli & Moser (2020), henceforth GM2020, study how intellectual property enforcement impacts innovation. They exploit the staggered introduction of copyright protections across Italian states during the Napoleonic era to assess their impact on opera production. Using data on Opera premieres, they find that copyright introduction boosted the production of new operas works and their quality. 

Giorcelli & Moser (2020), henceforth GM2020, exploit the staggered rollout of formal copyright protections across Italian states during the Napoleonic era to measure how IP enforcement shapes cultural innovation. Using data on opera premieres, they find that the introduction of copyright led to increases in both the quantity and quality of new operas. Specifically, they implement a differences-in-differences design, where Napoleon's copyright law is applied only to Venetia and Lombardy in 1801, and other Italian states conquered by Napoleon do not.  


I analyse the validity of the results presented in GM2020. I use publicly accesible data to attempt to reproduce their findings and critically assess the validity of key aspects of the identification strategy. Overall, I find the empirical results of GM2020 are neither internally nor externally valid, with various datasets within their replication package being inconsistent with each other and with external sources. Running their empirical analysis on available data does not yield the same results they find does not support the parallel trends assumption. Further, the identification strategy hinges on a flawed understanding of Napoleonic laws and implementation. Particulalry, the copyright law is not implemented in Venetia until 1806, at which point it implemented across Napoleonic Italy, encompassing all of northern and central Italy.
